Here is a nifty little app that automatically shrinks all the links and url's you copy to your clipboard.

Get rid of those clumsy browser add ons and slow web sites you've been using to generate small links, and stop thinking about it. With LittleLink, is just a matter of copying and pasting.

Every time you hit CMD-C or copy a link or url, LittleLink will automatically generate a short version of it and put it back on your Clipboard. You can then just hit CMD-V or paste it anywhere you want. 

Since it's a native OSX app that runs in your menu bar, it works in every application. No plugins, no accounts, no configuration. Just set it to run at login, and forget about it.

It also features an "Exclusions" list, where you can add the domain names you don't want to be shortened. A really useful feature for those private links you don't want to share.

The following URL shortening services are supported:

* is.gd
* su.pr
* goo.gl
* to.ly
* url.cx
* tinyurl.com

More services will be coming soon.
